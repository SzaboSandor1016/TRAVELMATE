# TRAVELMATE

It is a mobile application for Android platform,
that allows us to plan our road trips, holidays, weekends by
providing features like finding nearby hospitality venues, accommodations, landmarks or museums etc. 
to a start place selected by either finding it by searching based on its address, name or by using the device's current location.

We can also plan routes leading through multiple of the selected ones, view the estimated distance and duration needed to get to each of them.
Also, it is possible to start a GPS based navigation that leads us to each of the seleced places in the route, handling those cases too when we miss a turn accidently.

The app also makes it possible to share our road trip plans with others and plan it together, or just simply keep it for yourself
